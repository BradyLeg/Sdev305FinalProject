# Week Task Manager 

This project was worked by Brady Leggett and Timmy Williams. 

## Features

What this website does is allows you to enter in tasks into a calender via a page form to keep track of tasks. After the form has been submitted, the site then sends you to a thank you page displaying all the info that was submitted to the calendar. This info also gets validated on the client side and server side before being sent to a database. The user then can go to the calendar page by clicking a button which displays the tasks submitted in a week format. The user can click a button to show the information of specific tasks and click again to hide it. There is also an admin page that displays all the tasks entered into the calender with no calendar format. The webpages also adjust depending on screen size.

## Limitations

* We only displayed tasks in a single week format because we figured that trying to display the seemily infinte amount of days that can be selected would be difficult.

* Tasks can't be removed since we weren't able to figure out the the code for it.
